## About JSON

In computing, **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)** is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). It is a very common data format used for asynchronous browser–server communication, including as a replacement for XML in some AJAX-style systems. For more detail see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>


```{r graphics, out.width="400px",  Echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("jsonWiki.png")
```

## Read JSON in R

To read JSON data type, we need to install some pacakage such as `jsonlite`. 

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
data<-fromJSON("C:/Users/slim22/ProjectData.json")

```
