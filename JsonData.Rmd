## About JSON

In computing, **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)** is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). It is a very common data format used for asynchronous browser–server communication, including as a replacement for XML in some AJAX-style systems. For more detail see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>  

json looks like below.(from wikipedia)  


```{r graphics, out.width="400px",  Echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("jsonWiki.png")
```

## Read JSON in R

To read JSON data type, we need to install some pacakage such as `jsonlite`. Then using `fromJSON` function, we can read the data easily. 
For the practice, bring JSON data sample from <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/age-adjusted-death-rates-for-the-top-10-leading-causes-of-death-united-states-2013>. 


```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
## install.package("jsonlite")
library(jsonlite)

data<-fromJSON("C:/Users/slim22/ProjectData.json")
subdata<- data.frame(data$data[,c(9,11,12,13,14)])
colnames(subdata) <- c("Year", "Cause", "State", "Deaths", "Age") 

subdata$Deaths <- as.numeric(subdata$Deaths)
subdata$Age <- as.numeric(subdata$Age)

str(subdata)

```
