## About JSON

**JavaScript Object Notation(JSON)** is a data interchange format created from a subset of JavaScript. JSON's appeal as an slthernative XML comes from smaller HTTP messages and less complicated syntax. The smaller message and simpler syntax can provide a significant performance advantage over XML. For more details see <https://documentation.progress.com>


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Read JSON in R

To read JSON data type, we need to install some pacakage such as `jsonlite`. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
data<-fromJSON("C:/Users/slim22/ProjectData.json")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
